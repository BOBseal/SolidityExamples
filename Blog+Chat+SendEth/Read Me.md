A Solidity Smart Contract that Acts as A Decentralized Simple Chat Application Backend.
This is basically a fork of Daulat Hussain's Chat App contract that I upgraded for better suitability to my needs.
Now this contract has the Basic functions of a Social Media Platform that Runs entirely on the Blockchain.
The Transaction function is a Ledger and not the actual transfer util, Transfers has to be done through wallet api and then Update and Save changes to the Contract.
I have done only basic Functionality tests uptill now and I can guarantee that the Contract has some Vulnerabilities.
